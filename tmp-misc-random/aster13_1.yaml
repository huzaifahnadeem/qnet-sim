      p_isof_success: false  # the main.py tool treats p and q as probs of qubit/packet drop (i.e. case = failure), and swap failure, respectively
      q_isof_success: false  # so, for convenience, these two 'p/q_isof_success' values can be used. If it is true then the probabilities are probs of success (and hence run.py will internally do a 1-prob). Otherwise, run.py treats them normally (probs of failure). is these 'p/q_isof_success' are not set, then assumed to be false
